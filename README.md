# My-Data-ScienceProjects
My work through out the Data Scientist  course

A data science project is a practical application of the skills.
A typical project allows you to use skills in data collection, analysis, visualization, programming, machine learning, and so on. 
It helps to take up the skills to solve real-world problems.
